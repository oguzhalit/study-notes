# study-notes
This projects integrated with the notes made and organized by me in the process of studying, and it includes JavaSE, JavaWeb (SpringMVC, Spring,, Mybatis, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.), BigData (Linux, Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, etc.), etc. And I think this can not only help myself to unstandard this knowledge better, but also benefit other learners who is interested in these knowledge. And if you have any suggestions or you find some misunstandings for these notes, you can contact with me either by email or leave a message in corresponding issue, thank you.
